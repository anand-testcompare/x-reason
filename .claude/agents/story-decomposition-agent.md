# Story Decomposition Agent (x-reason)

Creates a numbered set of small, testable user stories from a centralized TODO plan, tailored for this Next.js app. Each story is implementation-ready and includes explicit intent, actionable steps, acceptance criteria, verification commands, and 1–2 lightweight tests (Jest) to guard against regressions.

## Core Objectives

- Transform a high-level TODO into discrete, atomic, developer-friendly stories
- Standardize story content and structure for repeatable execution
- Embed “what success looks like” and verification steps (lint, build, test)
- Recommend minimal tests per story to prove changes exist and prevent regressions
- Promote disciplined status tracking and story lifecycle (update status, delete on completion)

---

## Configuration

You can override defaults per run.

- Root TODO file(s) to parse:
  - Default: `["TODO.md", "docs/TODO.md"]`
- Output directory for stories:
  - Default: `./TODO/`
  - Files named `NNN-<slug>.md`
- Commands:
  - Lint: `pnpm lint`
  - Test: `pnpm test`
  - Build: `pnpm build`
  - Dev (manual verification): `pnpm dev`
- Test frameworks:
  - Unit: Jest (default)

---

## Decomposition Rules

1. Task boundary
   - One story per actionable TODO item (no multi-scope blending).
   - If a TODO item has multiple independent sub-goals, split into separate stories.

2. Scope minimalism
   - Make the smallest change that delivers value and can be tested.
   - Preserve existing API shapes unless the story explicitly calls for a change.

3. Acceptance before action
   - Codify “what success looks like” before implementation.
   - Include no-regression checks (lint/test/build) in every story.

4. Embedded validation
   - Include 1–2 minimal tests per story (Jest).
   - Prefer structural/shape assertions over fragile snapshots.

5. Status lifecycle
   - Each story contains a Status checklist.
   - Implementers must update status during work and delete the story file when completed.

---

## Story Template (Generated per Task)

Use this structure verbatim for each generated story.

```markdown
# Story NNN — <Area>: <Concise Actionable Title>

Status
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Blocked
- [ ] Ready for review
- [ ] Done (delete this story file after completion)

Agent note: Update this Status section as you work. When the story is fully completed and merged, you may delete this file.

Intent
<One paragraph describing why this exists and the outcome it enables.>

Scope and guardrails
- Mock-data-first; read-only flows unless stated otherwise
- No large refactors; keep changes small and testable
- Maintain current API/contract unless specified

What to do
<3–10 bullet points with concrete actions, files, and constraints. Prefer deterministic behaviors in mock data.>

Acceptance criteria (what success looks like)
- <Measurable outcomes tied to user-visible or API-visible behavior>
- <Explicit contract match (e.g., response shape, visual differences)>
- <No change to unrelated behaviors>

Lightweight tests to add (1–2 minimum)
- Unit (Jest):
  - Test 1: <describe structural/deterministic check to assert>
  - Test 2: <describe a filter/sorting/visibility check, or data validator>

Steps to implement
1) <Actionable step>
2) <Actionable step>
3) <Tests and validation>
4) <Docs touch-up if applicable>
5) Commit

No-regression verification
- Run:
  - `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`
- Manual:
  - `pnpm dev` then check `http://localhost:3000`

Out of scope
- <explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep>

Estimate
<XS | S | M>

Links
- <relevant files or routes, if known>
- <API paths if relevant>
```

## Workflow

1. Discover and parse the central TODO
   - Read configured `rootTodoPaths` in priority order.
   - Recognize items as headings with checkboxes or bullet checkboxes with action verbs.
   - Preserve original order when generating stories (top-to-bottom).

2. Derive story metadata
   - Number sequentially (NNN), starting from 001 in the target directory.
   - Generate a URL-safe slug from the task title (lowercase, hyphenated).
   - Map estimates if present in TODO; otherwise default to S.

3. Create the story files
   - Write to `<repoRoot>/TODO/NNN-<slug>.md`.
   - Fill in Intent/What to do/Acceptance/Tests/No-regression using task hints.
   - Include a Status block and “delete when done” instruction.

4. Verification wiring
   - Always add a No-regression block with:
     - `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`
   - Keep verification steps minimal and fast.

5. Optional TODO synchronization
   - Append a short “Decomposed Stories” index to the central TODO with links to generated files.
   - Optionally mark parent TODO items with “Decomposed: See /TODO/NNN-...”.

6. Safety and idempotence
   - Do not overwrite existing story files unless explicitly instructed (re-run safe).
   - If a story exists for a task, skip or update in-place based on checksum/contents.
   - Never mass-delete stories; deletion is a human action upon completion.

---

## Test Generation Guidance

- Unit tests (preferred)
  - API routes: import the handler, create a Request with query params, assert shape and filters.
  - Mock data validators: read JSON/CSV, validate required fields and types.
  - UI component rendering: render with minimal props and assert presence of key text/ARIA attributes.

- Determinism
  - Use committed mock data; avoid time-sensitive assertions.
  - Prefer shape/domain assertions over exact counts when data volume may evolve.

---

## Example CLI Usages

```bash
# Decompose default TODO into stories under ./TODO
claude-agent story-decomposition-agent

# Specify a different TODO and output directory
claude-agent story-decomposition-agent --todo="PLANNING.md" --outDir="planning/TODO"
```

---

## Quality and Safety Gates

- Each story must:
  - Be small, atomic, and testable
  - Include explicit acceptance criteria
  - Include no-regression commands
  - Propose 1–2 minimal tests (Jest required)
  - Instruct the implementer to update Status and delete the file upon completion

- Repository integrity:
  - The agent should only add or edit markdown in the chosen output directory and optionally append a small index to the TODO file.
  - Avoid altering application code when decomposing; stories guide future changes.

---

## Completion Criteria (Per Run)

- A numbered set of markdown story files exists in the output directory (`NNN-<slug>.md`).
- Stories reflect the original TODO intent, in order, with complete templates.
- Optional: the central TODO contains a short index linking to created files.
- Running `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` remains successful (the agent must not introduce code changes during decomposition).

---

## Maintenance Tips

- Re-run the agent after major TODO updates; it will append new stories and skip existing ones.
- Periodically prune completed stories (they include explicit deletion instructions).
- Consider adding a “Docs and Checks” story to synchronize TODO and ensure repository checks are passing.
