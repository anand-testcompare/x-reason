  ### End training data ###

  Using the above training data output the task list to solve the user query below.
  User Query: "${query}"

  Let's take this step by step. 
  1. Recall the steps best solves the user query using the supplied training data above.
  2. Output the steps as an ordered list. 
  If the output of step is used as input for another step, use the phrase "using the output of step x..."

  return { user, system };

export async function programmer(query: string, functionCatalog: string) {
  const system = `
  You are X-Reason, the State Machine Architect. X-Reason outputs state machines in response to the provided list of steps using the X-Reason DSL.
  Approach:
  X-Reason carefully analyzes the user's query, breaking it down into discrete steps.
  If a step can't be mapped mapped to a function found in your training data, X-Reason judiciously decides to omit it to maintain the integrity of the state machine.
  X-Reason never outputs a state where the id is not found in your training data
  X-Reason is never chatty.
  X-Reason always respond in JSON that conforms to the the X-Reason DSL.
  ### Start X-Reason DSL TypeScript definition ###
  \`\`\`
  export type StateConfig = {
  id: string;
  transitions?: Array<{
    on: string;
    target: string;
    actions?: string;
  }>;
  type?: 'parallel' | 'final';
  onDone?: Array<{
    target: string;
    actions?: string;
  }>;
  states?: StateConfig[];
 };
 ### End X-Reason DSL TypeScript definition ###
  `;
  const trainingData = await getTrainingData();
  const user = `Output the X-Reason state machine.

Let's take this step by step:
1. Construct the state machine based on the supplied steps using the X-Reason DSL
2. When instructions include "if then else" statements include multiple transitions, one for each condition. For example if th instructions are: "Have the user accept the terms of service. If the user accepts the TOS go to age confirmation else exit." the state machine would be:
[
  {
    "id": "AcceptTOS",
    "transitions": [
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "AgeConfirmation" },
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" },
      { "on": "ERROR", "target": "failure" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "AgeConfirmation",
    "transitions": [
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" },
      { "on": "ERROR", "target": "failure" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "success",
    "type": "final"
  },
  {
    "id": "failure",
    "type": "final"
  }
]
In this solution "If the user accepts the TOS go to age confirmation" is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "AgeConfirmation" } transition and "else exit." is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" } transition. 
The failure transition is reserved for application errors that occur at runtime.
Let's looks at another example of if/else logic: 
"If the user is 18 or over proceed to register the user else exit." would result in the following state config:
{
    "id": "AgeConfirmation",
    "transitions": [
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "RegisterUser" },
      { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" },
      { "on": "ERROR", "target": "failure" }
    ]
}
In this solution "If the user is 18 or over proceed to register" is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "RegisterUser" } transition and "else exit" is represented by the { "on": "CONTINUE", "target": "success" } transition
The failure transition is reserved for application errors that occur at runtime.
There are only two acceptable event values for the "on" attribute: "CONTINUE" and "ERROR". The "ERROR" event can only target the "failure" state
4. Make sure all state ID values in the state machine correspond to a value found in function catalog below. DO NOT INVENT YOUR OWN STATES!!!
Function Catalog:
${functionCatalog}

${trainingData}

If steps are
${query}

The state machine is?

export async function aiTransition(taskList: string, currentState: string, payload: string) {
