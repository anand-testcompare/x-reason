Intent
Add a concise migration notes section to README.md explaining the provider consolidation and removal of client credentials. This helps existing contributors understand the architectural changes and update their local environments.

Scope and guardrails
- Update README.md only; no code changes
- Keep migration notes brief and actionable
- Focus on what changed and what developers need to do
- No detailed technical implementation docs (keep high-level)

What to do
- Add "Migration Notes" or "Recent Changes" section to README.md
- Document key changes:
  - Provider consolidation to Vercel AI SDK
  - Removal of client-side credential entry
  - Deletion of `/api/openai/` and `/api/gemini/` directories
  - New server-side-only API key configuration
- Include action items for developers:
  - Update local `.env.local` with server-side keys
  - Remove any cached client-side credentials (localStorage)
  - Update any custom integrations to use new API routes
- Add reference to relevant stories or documentation
- Keep tone neutral and informative

Acceptance criteria (what success looks like)
- README.md contains clear migration notes section
- Changes are explained at appropriate level of detail
- Action items for developers are explicit
- References to further documentation included
- Section is easy to find (near top of README)

Lightweight tests to add (1–2 minimum)
- Manual verification:
  - Test 1: Review migration notes for accuracy and completeness
  - Test 2: Verify action items are sufficient for existing contributors

Steps to implement
1) Identify appropriate location in README.md (near top or after "Overview")
2) Add "Migration Notes" section with header
3) List key architectural changes
4) Document action items for developers
5) Add links to relevant documentation (AGENTS.md, reasoning README)
6) Review for clarity and conciseness
7) Commit

No-regression verification
- Run:
  - `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`
- Manual:
  - Review README.md for clarity and accuracy

Out of scope
- Detailed technical documentation (keep high-level)
- Inline code examples (link to examples instead)
- Version history or changelog (separate document)
