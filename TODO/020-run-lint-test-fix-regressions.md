Status
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Blocked
- [ ] Ready for review
- [ ] Done (delete this story file after completion)

Agent note: Update this Status section as you work. When the story is fully completed and merged, you may delete this file.

## Intent

Execute final verification pass to ensure all previous stories are integrated correctly. Run comprehensive linting and testing, resolve any regressions introduced during the Gateway migration, and confirm the application is production-ready.

## Scope and guardrails

- Run all verification commands: lint, test, build, type-check
- Fix any regressions or issues discovered
- Do NOT introduce new features or refactoring
- Focus on stability and correctness
- Ensure all tests pass with 100% success rate
- Verify build succeeds without errors or warnings
- Document any known issues or limitations

## What to do

1. Run comprehensive verification suite:
   ```bash
   # Linting
   pnpm lint

   # Type checking
   pnpm tsc --noEmit

   # Unit tests
   pnpm test

   # Build for production
   pnpm build
   ```

2. If linting fails:
   - Review linting errors
   - Fix style issues, unused imports, type errors
   - Re-run `pnpm lint` until clean
   - Consider `pnpm lint --fix` for auto-fixable issues

3. If type checking fails:
   - Review TypeScript errors
   - Fix type mismatches, missing types, incorrect usage
   - Ensure all new types are properly exported and imported
   - Re-run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` until clean

4. If tests fail:
   - Review test failures and error messages
   - Fix broken tests or underlying code issues
   - Ensure all new tests are properly configured
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly in tests
   - Re-run `pnpm test` until 100% pass rate

5. If build fails:
   - Review build errors
   - Fix import errors, missing files, configuration issues
   - Ensure all API routes are properly exported
   - Verify Next.js configuration is correct
   - Re-run `pnpm build` until successful

6. Run manual smoke tests:
   ```bash
   # Start development server
   pnpm dev

   # In browser:
   # - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   # - Test provider selection UI
   # - Test chat functionality with all three providers
   # - Verify error messages for missing credentials
   # - Check that model selection works correctly
   ```

7. Document verification results:
   - Create or update `VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md` with:
     - Lint status: ✓ Pass / ✗ Fail (with details)
     - Type check status: ✓ Pass / ✗ Fail (with details)
     - Test status: ✓ Pass / ✗ Fail (with details)
     - Build status: ✓ Pass / ✗ Fail (with details)
     - Manual smoke test status: ✓ Pass / ✗ Fail (with details)
     - Known issues or limitations
     - Recommended next steps

## Acceptance criteria (what success looks like)

- `pnpm lint` passes with no errors
- `pnpm tsc --noEmit` passes with no type errors
- `pnpm test` passes with 100% test success rate
- `pnpm build` completes successfully
- Development server starts without errors
- Manual smoke tests pass for all core functionality
- All three providers (OpenAI, Gemini, XAI) work correctly
- Gateway-only authentication is enforced
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- Documentation is accurate and complete
- `VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md` documents final status
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Lightweight tests to add (1–2 minimum)

This is a verification story, not a feature story. The focus is on running existing tests and ensuring they pass. However:
- If new regressions are discovered, add regression tests to prevent future issues
- Example: If provider selection breaks, add a test to verify it works

## Steps to implement

1) Set up environment:
   - Ensure `.env.local` has `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` set
   - Remove any deprecated provider-specific keys

2) Run lint:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```
   - Fix any errors
   - Re-run until clean

3) Run type check:
   ```bash
   pnpm tsc --noEmit
   ```
   - Fix any type errors
   - Re-run until clean

4) Run tests:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```
   - Fix any test failures
   - Re-run until 100% pass

5) Run build:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
   - Fix any build errors
   - Re-run until successful

6) Start dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

7) Run manual smoke tests:
   - Test provider selection UI
   - Test chat with OpenAI
   - Test chat with Gemini
   - Test chat with XAI
   - Test error handling (missing credentials)
   - Test model selection

8) Document results in `VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md`

9) If all pass, mark story as done

10) If issues found, fix them and repeat verification

## No-regression verification

This story IS the regression verification. The criteria are:
- All automated checks pass (lint, test, build)
- All manual smoke tests pass
- No functionality broken by Gateway migration
- All three providers work correctly
- Error handling works as expected

## Out of scope

- Adding new features or enhancements
- Refactoring code for optimization
- Performance testing or load testing
- Security audits or penetration testing
- Deployment to production (separate process)

## Estimate

L (comprehensive verification and issue resolution can be time-consuming)

## Links

- `apps/x-reason-web/` - Application directory
- All test files in `apps/x-reason-web/src/app/test/`
- `VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md` - Document to create

## Dependencies

- All previous stories (001-019) - completed

## Notes for implementer

This is the final checkpoint before considering the Gateway migration complete. Take your time to thoroughly test all functionality. If you discover regressions, trace them back to the story that introduced them and fix them properly. Don't rush - stability is more important than speed.

Common issues to watch for:
- Environment variable naming mismatches
- Import errors due to file moves
- Type errors from new interfaces
- Test failures due to mock configuration
- Build errors from missing exports
- Runtime errors from missing error handling

If you find a regression that requires significant changes, consider creating a new story to fix it properly rather than rushing a fix.
