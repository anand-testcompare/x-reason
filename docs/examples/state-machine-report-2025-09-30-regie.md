# State Machine Execution Report

**Generated:** 9/30/2025, 2:07:17 PM
**Query:** "I'd like to sign up for the premium plan with all features"
**Progress:** 6/6 steps completed

## 1. AcceptTOS ✅ Completed

Display the applicable Terms of Service and Premium Addendum (clearly labeled, current version and effective date) and present an explicit consent control (checkbox or “I accept” button) paired with a required statement that acceptance is required to activate the premium plan with all features.

Validate the user action: if the user clicks “I accept,” capture and persist an acceptance record containing user identifier (or provisional account/email), selected plan (“Premium — all features”), TOS version, timestamp (UTC), user IP address and user-agent, and the consent UI metadata (checkbox/button used and page URL); if the user declines, abort the signup and surface a message that acceptance is required.

Create audit and event entries (e.g., log event and emit “TOSAccepted” event to the signup workflow) so downstream systems (billing, provisioning, legal) are notified.

Send a confirmation to the user (email or on-screen) summarizing acceptance, linking to the stored TOS snapshot, and then transition the flow to the next step (billing/payment collection and premium feature provisioning).

## 2. AgeConfirmation ✅ Completed

Display an age-confirmation prompt asking the user to confirm they meet the minimum age (e.g., “I confirm I am 18 or older”) and/or enter their date of birth; require a valid response before proceeding.  
If the user confirms (and DOB, if entered, verifies age), record the confirmation (timestamp, account/email, IP) and advance to the next step (payment/account creation for the premium plan).  
If the user denies or DOB indicates they are underage, block the premium signup, show an ineligibility message, and present available alternatives (parental-consent flow if supported, child-safe plan, or contact support).  
If the field is missing or invalid, prevent progression and re-prompt for a valid age confirmation.

## 3. RegisterUser ✅ Completed

Validate input (email, password, selected "premium" plan, feature options) and check for existing account/duplicate email.
Create user record with hashed password and metadata.
Create billing customer and subscription record for the premium plan (price, interval, trial if applicable).
Charge payment method via payment gateway (handle declines/errors with rollback of created records).
On successful payment, mark subscription active and enable all premium feature entitlements/feature flags for the user.
Generate auth credentials/session token (or send account activation link if email verification required).
Send confirmation email with receipt/invoice and next steps; log event and update analytics.
Return success response with user ID, subscription ID, entitlements, and any required follow-up (e.g., email verification).

## 4. PartnerPlugins ✅ Completed

Invoke billing plugin with customer and plan details (premium, all-features), payment method, promo code if any, and idempotency key; wait for authorization and charge confirmation.  
If payment succeeds, call provisioning plugin to enable premium features on the account (feature flags, quotas, storage, API keys) and create/attach license record; return provisioning IDs.  
Call identity/verification plugin if required (KYC/2FA) and block finalization until verified; log verification status.  
Call subscription-management plugin to schedule renewals, set billing cycle, and store payment mandate.  
Send confirmation via notification plugin (email/SMS/in-app) with receipt, plan details, and support links.  
On any partner error, trigger compensating actions: refund or void charge, rollback provisioning, and notify user with actionable error; implement retry with exponential backoff for transient failures and preserve idempotency to avoid duplicate charges.  
Record audit events and metrics for billing, provisioning, and notifications; surface final success/failure status and relevant IDs to the caller.

## 5. SelectPlan ✅ Completed

Select the "Premium" plan with all features enabled.

- Record the selection in the user's session and persist it to the database.
- Retrieve plan metadata (feature list, limits, billing interval) and populate the confirmation UI.
- Calculate pricing (base price, taxes, discounts, proration) and show a cost summary.
- Validate eligibility (promotions, region, feature availability) and surface errors if any.
- Reserve entitlements by creating a provisional subscription token or draft subscription with feature flags.
- Transition the flow to the next step (payment/checkout), updating UI state and queuing analytics/audit events.

## 6. SpecialOffers ✅ Completed

Query available promotions and the user's eligibility for the premium plan with all features.  
Select and auto-apply the best applicable offer (if any) to the subscription.  
Recalculate the checkout summary and billing schedule to reflect trial periods, one‑time discounts, or adjusted recurring price.  
Attach offer metadata to the pending subscription/order and log the applied promotion for tracking and expiration.  
Present the updated offer summary (savings, trial length, next charge date) to the user for confirmation; if the user accepts, finalize the applied offer and proceed to payment/activation; if the user declines, remove the offer and revert to the base premium price.
